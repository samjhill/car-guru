ChatGPT Response: As a seasoned expert in Mazda vehicles, I would advise that the 1994 Mazda MX-5 Miata M-Edition in Montego Blue Mica over tan leather upholstery is indeed a worthwhile deal considering its low mileage and excellent condition. The car comes with extensive documentation, clean Carfax report, and service records, making it a desirable collector's item. Key factors for the buyer to consider include the overall originality, exceptional condition, and the included accessories like the ownerâ€™s manuals, window sticker, and spare parts. The issue with the airbag light flickering intermittently should be addressed post-purchase. Given the strong interest shown in the bidding section, a reasonable maximum bid for this particular car could be around $13,500 to $14,000. Insights from the comments section highlight the exceptional condition of the car, its desirability among collectors, and the nostalgia associated with Mazda's 1990s lineup. There is mention of the car's stunning appearance, performance characteristics, and unique features specific to the M-Edition Miata. Overall, there is a positive sentiment and genuine appreciation for this well-preserved Mazda Miata.
