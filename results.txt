This 1966 Ford Bronco with a Cummins 4BT turbodiesel engine seems to be a unique and well-executed build with modern upgrades. The diesel powertrain adds an interesting twist to this classic model. The overall condition, including the bodywork and paint, looks well done from the comments and detailed description.
